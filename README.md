>>>>   Caesar cypher with Python

Craete working directory

$ mkdir pyCaesar

$ cd pyCaesar


Simplest way to to run Caesar encription 

(Caesar cyphering is based on adding set step to each letter in a message, 
for example, message "aaa" with step "1" will produce encripted message "bbb").

As a prerequisite you meed to have Python installed on your system. 
And in case of remote server it is not the easiest task.

Anyway, make a URL copy from Code > Clone > HTTPS and install into working directory

$ git clone https://github.com/vi-u/Python-Caesar.git

Or use zip file to install it your working directory

To run it from working directory just type a command:

$ python cc_encript.py
